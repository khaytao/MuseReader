# Introduction

This repository is built to provide an easy object-oriented interface for muselsl for use in hackathons, personal projects, etc..

See these files in the src folder


Additionally, several python files in the root folder and serve as live examples as part of
a DSP and Gesture Recognition workshop that I instruct.

## Code Sources

This project relies on BlueMuse:
